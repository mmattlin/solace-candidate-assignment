## Additional Improvements

If I had more time on this assignment, I would make the following improvements:

- Add pagination to the table with infinite scroll
- Complete the DB query logic for filtering the specialties, year of experience and phone number. This might require switching to raw SQL.
- Cache the initial list of unfiltered advocates, assuming it is very large
- Improve UI:
  - Format phone number
  - Show spinner while data is loading
  - Add a search icon to the text input
  - Display the total number of results
